            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <p>My name is Katherine Panora, and this is my growth portfolio! Throughout highschool I have been learning coding, ranging from using resources like replit, python, popcode, and github. I'm looking foward into attending college and going forth with computer science!</p>

              <p>This was one of my very first projects, and it was intended so people worked in duos and got to know their new partner. I got to  meet someone new and learn more about them which was a new experience to me.</p>

                <p>Here, we were adding images and such into an empty array. Users are only able to see the images that they input if it is a working and non-broken link. The title encourages users to add images of animals, but in all honesty, it can be any link that sources an image and it'll pop up and be shown to the user!</p>

              <p>This was the project that I am most proud of, as I was able to master if, else, and else of statements. It's something I'd like to classify as a miniature game. Depending on what users input, it'll alter the outcome of what they classify as. In other words, the results are meant to reflect the user and make a silly, funny little connection.</p>
